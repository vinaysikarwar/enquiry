Enquiry Magento MNodule
-----------------------

Magento does not provide the functionality of showing contact enquiries in admin.

This extension do so, when ever a contact form is submitted the enquiry data will be shown in admin.After opening the particular enquiry admin can reply directly to the enquiry from admin.

This is like a ticket system.
